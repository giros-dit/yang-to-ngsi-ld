        A device MAY restrict the allowed values for this leaf,
        possibly depending on the type of the interface.
        For system-controlled interfaces, this leaf is the
        device-specific name of the interface. The 'config false'
        list interfaces/interface[name]/state contains the currently
        existing interfaces on the device.
        
        If a client tries to create configuration for a
        system-controlled interface that is not present in the
        corresponding state list, the server MAY reject
        the request if the implementation does not support
        pre-provisioning of interfaces or if the name refers to
        an interface that can never exist in the system. A
        NETCONF server MUST reply with an rpc-error with the
        error-tag 'invalid-value' in this case.
        
        The IETF model in RFC 7223 provides YANG features for the
        following (i.e., pre-provisioning and arbitrary-names),
        however they are omitted here:
        
         If the device supports pre-provisioning of interface
         configuration, the 'pre-provisioning' feature is
         advertised.
        
         If the device allows arbitrarily named user-controlled
         interfaces, the 'arbitrary-names' feature is advertised.
        
        When a configured user-controlled interface is created by
        the system, it is instantiated with the same name in the
        /interfaces/interface[name]/state list.

        A server implementation MAY map this leaf to the ifAlias

        mechanism to handle the differences in size and characters
        allowed between this leaf and ifAlias. The definition of
        such a mechanism is outside the scope of this document.
        
        Since ifAlias is defined to be stored in non-volatile
        storage, the MIB implementation MUST map ifAlias to the
        value of 'description' in the persistently stored
        datastore.
        
        Specifically, if the device supports ':startup', when
        ifAlias is read the device MUST return the value of
        'description' in the 'startup' datastore, and when it is
        written, it MUST be written to the 'running' and 'startup'
        datastores. Note that it is up to the implementation to
        
        decide whether to modify this single leaf in 'startup' or
        perform an implicit copy-config from 'running' to
        'startup'.
        
        If the device does not support ':startup', ifAlias MUST
        be mapped to the 'description' leaf in the 'running'
        datastore.

        Ethernet flow control is a mechanism by which a receiver
        may send PAUSE frames to a sender to stop transmission for
        a specified time.
        
        This setting should override auto-negotiated flow control
        settings. If left unspecified, and auto-negotiate is TRUE,
        flow control mode is negotiated with the peer interface.

        change the mastership if the tracked interface going
