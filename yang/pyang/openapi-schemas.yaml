      description: |
        The list of interfaces on the device.
        
        The status of an interface is available in this list in the
        operational state. If the configuration of a
        system-controlled interface cannot be used by the system
        (e.g., the interface hardware present does not match the
        interface type), then the configuration is not applied to
        the system-controlled interface shown in the operational
        state. If the configuration of a user-controlled interface
        cannot be used by the system, the configured interface is
        not instantiated in the operational state.
        
        System-controlled interfaces created by the system are
        always present in this list in the operational state,
        whether or not they are configured.

        A device MAY restrict the allowed values for this leaf,
        possibly depending on the type of the interface.
        For system-controlled interfaces, this leaf is the
        device-specific name of the interface.
        
        If a client tries to create configuration for a
        system-controlled interface that is not present in the
        operational state, the server MAY reject the request if
        the implementation does not support pre-provisioning of
        interfaces or if the name refers to an interface that can
        never exist in the system. A Network Configuration
        Protocol (NETCONF) server MUST reply with an rpc-error
        with the error-tag 'invalid-value' in this case.
        
        If the device supports pre-provisioning of interface
        configuration, the 'pre-provisioning' feature is
        advertised.
        
        If the device allows arbitrarily named user-controlled
        interfaces, the 'arbitrary-names' feature is advertised.
        
        When a configured user-controlled interface is created by
        the system, it is instantiated with the same name in the
        operational state.
        
        A server implementation MAY map this leaf to the ifName
        MIB object. Such an implementation needs to use some
        mechanism to handle the differences in size and characters
        allowed between this leaf and ifName. The definition of
        such a mechanism is outside the scope of this document.
