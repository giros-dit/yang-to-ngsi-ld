## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.notification_params import NotificationParams

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of NotificationParams from a JSON string
notification_params_instance = NotificationParams.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print NotificationParams.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
notification_params_dict = notification_params_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of NotificationParams from a dict
notification_params_form_dict = notification_params.from_dict(notification_params_dict)
