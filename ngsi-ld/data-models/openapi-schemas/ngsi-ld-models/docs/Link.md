# Link

NGSI-LD Entity Type that represents a link. A network link connects a local (source) node and a remote (destination) node via a set of the respective node's termination points.  It is  possible to have several links between the same source and destination nodes. Likewise, a link  could potentially be re-homed between termination points.  Therefore, in order to ensure that we would always know to distinguish between links, every link is identified by a dedicated link  identifier.  Note that a link models a point-to-point link, not a multipoint link. 

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**id** | **str** | Entity id.  | [optional] 
**type** | **str** | NGSI-LD Entity identifier. It has to be Link. | [optional] [default to 'Link']
**scope** | [**EntityScope**](EntityScope.md) |  | [optional] 
**location** | [**GeoProperty**](GeoProperty.md) |  | [optional] 
**observation_space** | [**GeoProperty**](GeoProperty.md) |  | [optional] 
**operation_space** | [**GeoProperty**](GeoProperty.md) |  | [optional] 
**created_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was entered into an NGSI-LD system.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**modified_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was last modified in an NGSI-LD system, e.g. in order to correct a previously entered incorrect value.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**deleted_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was deleted from an NGSI-LD system.  Entity deletion timestamp. See clause 4.8 It is only used in notifications reporting deletions and in the Temporal Representation of Entities (clause 4.5.6), Properties (clause 4.5.7), Relationships (clause 4.5.8) and LanguageProperties (clause 5.2.32).  | [optional] [readonly] 
**link_id** | [**LinkId**](LinkId.md) |  | 
**is_part_of** | [**IsPartOf**](IsPartOf.md) |  | 

## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.link import Link

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of Link from a JSON string
link_instance = Link.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print Link.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
link_dict = link_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of Link from a dict
link_form_dict = link.from_dict(link_dict)
```
