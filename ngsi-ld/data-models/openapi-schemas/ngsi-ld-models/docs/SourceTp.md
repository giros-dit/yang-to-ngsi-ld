## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.source_tp import SourceTp

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of SourceTp from a JSON string
source_tp_instance = SourceTp.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print SourceTp.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
source_tp_dict = source_tp_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of SourceTp from a dict
source_tp_form_dict = source_tp.from_dict(source_tp_dict)
