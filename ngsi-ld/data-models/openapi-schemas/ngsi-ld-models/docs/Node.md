```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.node import Node

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of Node from a JSON string
node_instance = Node.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print Node.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
node_dict = node_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of Node from a dict
node_form_dict = node.from_dict(node_dict)
