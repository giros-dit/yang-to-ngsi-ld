NGSI-LD Relationship Type. References the underlay network. In addition, it could refer to the underlay network of which an underlay node is a part. Also, it could refer to the underlay  topology where a supporting link is present or in which topology a supporting termination point  is present. 

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**type** | **str** | Node type.  | [optional] [default to 'Relationship']
**object** | **str** |  | 
**observed_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which a certain Property or Relationship became valid or was observed. For example, a temperature Value was measured by the sensor at this point in time.  | [optional] 
**dataset_id** | **str** | It allows identifying a set or group of target relationship objects.  | [optional] 
**created_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was entered into an NGSI-LD system.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**modified_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was last modified in an NGSI-LD system, e.g. in order to correct a previously entered incorrect value.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**deleted_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was deleted from an NGSI-LD system.  Entity deletion timestamp. See clause 4.8 It is only used in notifications reporting deletions and in the Temporal Representation of Entities (clause 4.5.6), Properties (clause 4.5.7), Relationships (clause 4.5.8) and LanguageProperties (clause 5.2.32).  | [optional] [readonly]

**previous_object** | **str** | Previous Relationship&#39;s target object. Only used in notifications.  | [optional] [readonly] 

## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.network_ref import NetworkRef

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of NetworkRef from a JSON string
network_ref_instance = NetworkRef.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print NetworkRef.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
network_ref_dict = network_ref_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of NetworkRef from a dict
network_ref_form_dict = network_ref.from_dict(network_ref_dict)
