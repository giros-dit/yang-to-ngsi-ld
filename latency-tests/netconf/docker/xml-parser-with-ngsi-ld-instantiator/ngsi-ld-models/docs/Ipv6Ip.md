## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.ipv6_ip import Ipv6Ip

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of Ipv6Ip from a JSON string
ipv6_ip_instance = Ipv6Ip.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print Ipv6Ip.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
ipv6_ip_dict = ipv6_ip_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of Ipv6Ip from a dict
ipv6_ip_form_dict = ipv6_ip.from_dict(ipv6_ip_dict)
