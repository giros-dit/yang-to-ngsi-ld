**value** | **str** |  | 
**observed_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which a certain Property or Relationship became valid or was observed. For example, a temperature Value was measured by the sensor at this point in time.  | [optional] 
**unit_code** | **str** | Property Value&#39;s unit code.  | [optional] 
**dataset_id** | **str** | It allows identifying a set or group of property values.  | [optional]

## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.ipv6_status import Ipv6Status

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of Ipv6Status from a JSON string
ipv6_status_instance = Ipv6Status.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print Ipv6Status.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
ipv6_status_dict = ipv6_status_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of Ipv6Status from a dict
ipv6_status_form_dict = ipv6_status.from_dict(ipv6_status_dict)
