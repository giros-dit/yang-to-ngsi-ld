# HasSensor

NGSI-LD Relationship Type to identify the sensors of the IoT device. 

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**type** | **str** | Node type.  | [optional] [default to 'Relationship']
**object** | **str** | Relationship&#39;s target object.  | [optional] 
**observed_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which a certain Property or Relationship became valid or was observed. For example, a temperature Value was measured by the sensor at this point in time.  | [optional] 
**dataset_id** | **str** | It allows identifying a set or group of target relationship objects.  | [optional] 
**created_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was entered into an NGSI-LD system.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**modified_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was last modified in an NGSI-LD system, e.g. in order to correct a previously entered incorrect value.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**deleted_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was deleted from an NGSI-LD system.  Entity deletion timestamp. See clause 4.8 It is only used in notifications reporting deletions and in the Temporal Representation of Entities (clause 4.5.6), Properties (clause 4.5.7), Relationships (clause 4.5.8) and LanguageProperties (clause 5.2.32).  | [optional] [readonly] 
**instance_id** | **str** | A URI uniquely identifying a Relationship instance (see clause 4.5.8). System generated.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**previous_object** | **str** | Previous Relationship&#39;s target object. Only used in notifications.  | [optional] [readonly] 

## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.has_sensor import HasSensor

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of HasSensor from a JSON string
has_sensor_instance = HasSensor.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print HasSensor.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
has_sensor_dict = has_sensor_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of HasSensor from a dict
has_sensor_form_dict = has_sensor.from_dict(has_sensor_dict)
