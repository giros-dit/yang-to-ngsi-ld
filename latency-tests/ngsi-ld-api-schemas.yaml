        5.6.4 Partial Attribute update.

        This operation allows performing a partial update on an NGSI-LD Entity's Attribute (Property or Relationship).
        A partial update only changes the elements provided in an Entity Fragment, leaving the rest as they are.
        This operation supports the deletion of sub-Attributes but not the deletion of the whole Attribute itself.

        5.10.2 Query Context Source Registrations.

        This operation allows discovering context source registrations from an NGSI-LD system.
        The behaviour of the discovery of context source registrations differs significantly from
        the querying of entities as described in clause 5.7.2. The approach is that the client
        submits a query for entities as described in clause 5.7.2, but instead of receiving
        the Entity information, it receives a list of Context Source Registrations describing
        Context Sources that possibly have some of the requested Entity information. This means
        that the requested Entities and Attributes are matched against the 'information' property
        as described in clause 5.12.

        If no temporal query is present, only Context Source Registrations for Context Sources
        providing latest information, i.e. without specified time intervals, are considered.
        If a temporal query is present only Context Source Registrations with matching time intervals,
        i.e. observationInterval or managementInterval, are considered.

        6.3.5 JSON-LD @context resolution

        In summary, from a developer's perspective, for POST, PATCH and PUT operations,
        if MIME type is "application/ld+json", then the associated @context shall be provided
        only as part of the request payload body. Likewise, if MIME type is "application/json",
        then the associated @context shall be provided only by using the JSON- LD Link header.
        No mixes are allowed, i.e. mixing options shall result in HTTP response errors.
        Implementations should provide descriptive error messages when these situations arise.

        In contrast, GET and DELETE operations always take their input @context from the JSON-LD Link Header.

        The definition of the general "ProblemDetails" data structure from
        IETF RFC 7807 [19] is reproduced inthis structure. Compared to the
        general framework defined in IETF RFC 7807 [19], the "status" and
        "detail" attributes are mandated to be included by the present document,
        to ensure that the response contains additional textual information about
        an error. IETF RFC 7807 [19] foresees extensibility of the
        "ProblemDetails" type. It is possible that particular APIs in the present
        document, or particular implementations, define extensions to define
        additional attributes that provide more information about the error.
