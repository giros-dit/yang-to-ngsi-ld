# Margin

Indicates the lowest alarm margin of any sensor on this component  The margin is the delta between the current sensor temperature and the thermal protection threshold for that sensor. Note that as multiple sensors may feed in, that this field and the instant field may be referencing different sensors.  YANG module: srl_nokia-platform-lc.yang 

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**type** | **str** | Node type.  | [optional] [default to 'Property']
**value** | **int** |  | 
**observed_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which a certain Property or Relationship became valid or was observed. For example, a temperature Value was measured by the sensor at this point in time.  | [optional] 
**unit_code** | **str** | Property Value&#39;s unit code.  | [optional] 
**dataset_id** | **str** | It allows identifying a set or group of property values.  | [optional] 
**created_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was entered into an NGSI-LD system.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**modified_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was last modified in an NGSI-LD system, e.g. in order to correct a previously entered incorrect value.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**deleted_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was deleted from an NGSI-LD system.  Entity deletion timestamp. See clause 4.8 It is only used in notifications reporting deletions and in the Temporal Representation of Entities (clause 4.5.6), Properties (clause 4.5.7), Relationships (clause 4.5.8) and LanguageProperties (clause 5.2.32).  | [optional] [readonly] 
**instance_id** | **str** | A URI uniquely identifying a Property instance, as mandated by (see clause 4.5.7). System generated.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**previous_value** | [**PropertyPreviousValue**](PropertyPreviousValue.md) |  | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.margin import Margin

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of Margin from a JSON string
margin_instance = Margin.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print Margin.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
margin_dict = margin_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of Margin from a dict
margin_form_dict = margin.from_dict(margin_dict)
