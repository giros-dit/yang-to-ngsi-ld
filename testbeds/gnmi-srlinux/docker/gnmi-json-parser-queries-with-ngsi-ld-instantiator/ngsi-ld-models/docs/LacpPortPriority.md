## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.lacp_port_priority import LacpPortPriority

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of LacpPortPriority from a JSON string
lacp_port_priority_instance = LacpPortPriority.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print LacpPortPriority.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
lacp_port_priority_dict = lacp_port_priority_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of LacpPortPriority from a dict
lacp_port_priority_form_dict = lacp_port_priority.from_dict(lacp_port_priority_dict)
