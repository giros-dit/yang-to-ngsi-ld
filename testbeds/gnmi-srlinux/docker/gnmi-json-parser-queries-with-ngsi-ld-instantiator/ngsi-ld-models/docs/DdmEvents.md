# DdmEvents

Controls the reporting of DDM events  When set to true, log events related to the Digital Diagnostic Monitoring (DDM) capabilities of the transceiver are generated.  When set to false, no DDM-related log events are generated for this port/transceiver.  When read from state this leaf always returns false (even if the configured value is true) when the Ethernet port is a copper/RJ45 port.  YANG module: srl_nokia-interfaces.yang 

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**type** | **str** | Node type.  | [optional] [default to 'Property']
**value** | **bool** |  | 
**observed_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which a certain Property or Relationship became valid or was observed. For example, a temperature Value was measured by the sensor at this point in time.  | [optional] 
**unit_code** | **str** | Property Value&#39;s unit code.  | [optional] 
**dataset_id** | **str** | It allows identifying a set or group of property values.  | [optional] 
**created_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was entered into an NGSI-LD system.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**modified_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was last modified in an NGSI-LD system, e.g. in order to correct a previously entered incorrect value.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**deleted_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was deleted from an NGSI-LD system.  Entity deletion timestamp. See clause 4.8 It is only used in notifications reporting deletions and in the Temporal Representation of Entities (clause 4.5.6), Properties (clause 4.5.7), Relationships (clause 4.5.8) and LanguageProperties (clause 5.2.32).  | [optional] [readonly] 
**instance_id** | **str** | A URI uniquely identifying a Property instance, as mandated by (see clause 4.5.7). System generated.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**previous_value** | [**PropertyPreviousValue**](PropertyPreviousValue.md) |  | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.ddm_events import DdmEvents

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of DdmEvents from a JSON string
ddm_events_instance = DdmEvents.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print DdmEvents.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
ddm_events_dict = ddm_events_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of DdmEvents from a dict
ddm_events_form_dict = ddm_events.from_dict(ddm_events_dict)
