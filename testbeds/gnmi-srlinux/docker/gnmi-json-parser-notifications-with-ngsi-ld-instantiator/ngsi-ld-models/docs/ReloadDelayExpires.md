## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.reload_delay_expires import ReloadDelayExpires

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of ReloadDelayExpires from a JSON string
reload_delay_expires_instance = ReloadDelayExpires.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print ReloadDelayExpires.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
reload_delay_expires_dict = reload_delay_expires_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of ReloadDelayExpires from a dict
reload_delay_expires_form_dict = reload_delay_expires.from_dict(reload_delay_expires_dict)
