**deleted_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was deleted from an NGSI-LD system.  Entity deletion timestamp. See clause 4.8 It is only used in notifications reporting deletions and in the Temporal Representation of Entities (clause 4.5.6), Properties (clause 4.5.7), Relationships (clause 4.5.8) and LanguageProperties (clause 5.2.32).  | [optional] [readonly]

## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.virtual_router_id import VirtualRouterId

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of VirtualRouterId from a JSON string
virtual_router_id_instance = VirtualRouterId.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print VirtualRouterId.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
virtual_router_id_dict = virtual_router_id_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of VirtualRouterId from a dict
virtual_router_id_form_dict = virtual_router_id.from_dict(virtual_router_id_dict)
