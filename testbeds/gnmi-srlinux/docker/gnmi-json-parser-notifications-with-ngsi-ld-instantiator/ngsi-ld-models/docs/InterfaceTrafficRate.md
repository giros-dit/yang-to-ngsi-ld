## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.interface_traffic_rate import InterfaceTrafficRate

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of InterfaceTrafficRate from a JSON string
interface_traffic_rate_instance = InterfaceTrafficRate.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print InterfaceTrafficRate.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
interface_traffic_rate_dict = interface_traffic_rate_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of InterfaceTrafficRate from a dict
interface_traffic_rate_form_dict = interface_traffic_rate.from_dict(interface_traffic_rate_dict)
