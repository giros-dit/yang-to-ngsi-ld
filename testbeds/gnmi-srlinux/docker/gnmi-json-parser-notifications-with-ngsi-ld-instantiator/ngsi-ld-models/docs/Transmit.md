# Transmit

Enables/disables the sending of PAUSE frames.  If auto-negotiation is enabled (applicable only to ports 1-48 of the 7220 IXR-D1 and to mgmt0 and mgmt0-standby ports) PAUSE frames are sent to the peer only if the peer advertised support for PAUSE frames.  YANG module: srl_nokia-interfaces.yang

## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.transmit import Transmit

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of Transmit from a JSON string
transmit_instance = Transmit.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print Transmit.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
transmit_dict = transmit_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of Transmit from a dict
transmit_form_dict = transmit.from_dict(transmit_dict)
