## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**type** | **str** | Node type.  | [optional] [default to 'Relationship']
**object** | **str** | Relationship with Entity type YANGIdentity. | 
**observed_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which a certain Property or Relationship became valid or was observed. For example, a temperature Value was measured by the sensor at this point in time.  | [optional] 
**dataset_id** | **str** | It allows identifying a set or group of target relationship objects.  | [optional] 
**created_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was entered into an NGSI-LD system.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**modified_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was last modified in an NGSI-LD system, e.g. in order to correct a previously entered incorrect value.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**deleted_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was deleted from an NGSI-LD system.  Entity deletion timestamp. See clause 4.8 It is only used in notifications reporting deletions and in the Temporal Representation of Entities (clause 4.5.6), Properties (clause 4.5.7), Relationships (clause 4.5.8) and LanguageProperties (clause 5.2.32).  | [optional] [readonly]

## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.interface_subinterface_type import InterfaceSubinterfaceType

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of InterfaceSubinterfaceType from a JSON string
interface_subinterface_type_instance = InterfaceSubinterfaceType.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print InterfaceSubinterfaceType.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
interface_subinterface_type_dict = interface_subinterface_type_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of InterfaceSubinterfaceType from a dict
interface_subinterface_type_form_dict = interface_subinterface_type.from_dict(interface_subinterface_type_dict)
