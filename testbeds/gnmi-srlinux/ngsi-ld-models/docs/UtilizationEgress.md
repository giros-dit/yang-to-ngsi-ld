## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.utilization_egress import UtilizationEgress

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of UtilizationEgress from a JSON string
utilization_egress_instance = UtilizationEgress.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print UtilizationEgress.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
utilization_egress_dict = utilization_egress_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of UtilizationEgress from a dict
utilization_egress_form_dict = utilization_egress.from_dict(utilization_egress_dict)
