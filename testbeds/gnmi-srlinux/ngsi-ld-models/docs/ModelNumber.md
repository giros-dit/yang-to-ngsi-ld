# ModelNumber

Model information for the adapter  This is the information as read from the EEPROM of the part. The string is expected to contain printable ASCII characters, but unprintable ASCII characters read from the EEPROM are not filtered out.  YANG module: srl_nokia-interfaces.yang 

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**type** | **str** | Node type.  | [optional] [default to 'Property']
**value** | **str** |  | 
**observed_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which a certain Property or Relationship became valid or was observed. For example, a temperature Value was measured by the sensor at this point in time.  | [optional] 
**unit_code** | **str** | Property Value&#39;s unit code.  | [optional] 
**dataset_id** | **str** | It allows identifying a set or group of property values.  | [optional] 
**created_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was entered into an NGSI-LD system.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**modified_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was last modified in an NGSI-LD system, e.g. in order to correct a previously entered incorrect value.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**deleted_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was deleted from an NGSI-LD system.  Entity deletion timestamp. See clause 4.8 It is only used in notifications reporting deletions and in the Temporal Representation of Entities (clause 4.5.6), Properties (clause 4.5.7), Relationships (clause 4.5.8) and LanguageProperties (clause 5.2.32).  | [optional] [readonly] 
**instance_id** | **str** | A URI uniquely identifying a Property instance, as mandated by (see clause 4.5.7). System generated.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**previous_value** | [**PropertyPreviousValue**](PropertyPreviousValue.md) |  | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.model_number import ModelNumber

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of ModelNumber from a JSON string
model_number_instance = ModelNumber.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print ModelNumber.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
model_number_dict = model_number_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of ModelNumber from a dict
model_number_form_dict = model_number.from_dict(model_number_dict)
