## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.lsa_initial_wait import LsaInitialWait

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of LsaInitialWait from a JSON string
lsa_initial_wait_instance = LsaInitialWait.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(LsaInitialWait.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
lsa_initial_wait_dict = lsa_initial_wait_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of LsaInitialWait from a dict
lsa_initial_wait_from_dict = LsaInitialWait.from_dict(lsa_initial_wait_dict)
