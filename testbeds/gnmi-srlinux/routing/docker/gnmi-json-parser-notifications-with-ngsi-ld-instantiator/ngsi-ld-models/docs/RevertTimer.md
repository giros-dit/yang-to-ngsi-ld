## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.revert_timer import RevertTimer

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of RevertTimer from a JSON string
revert_timer_instance = RevertTimer.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(RevertTimer.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
revert_timer_dict = revert_timer_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of RevertTimer from a dict
revert_timer_from_dict = RevertTimer.from_dict(revert_timer_dict)
