## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.med_fast_transmit_repeat_count import MedFastTransmitRepeatCount

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of MedFastTransmitRepeatCount from a JSON string
med_fast_transmit_repeat_count_instance = MedFastTransmitRepeatCount.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(MedFastTransmitRepeatCount.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
med_fast_transmit_repeat_count_dict = med_fast_transmit_repeat_count_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of MedFastTransmitRepeatCount from a dict
med_fast_transmit_repeat_count_from_dict = MedFastTransmitRepeatCount.from_dict(med_fast_transmit_repeat_count_dict)
