Name | Type | Description | Notes

**type** | **str** | Node type.  | [optional] [default to 'Property']
**value** | [**Geometry**](Geometry.md) |  | [optional] 
**observed_at** | **datetime** | It is defined as the temporal Property at which a certain Property or Relationship became valid or was observed. For example, a temperature Value was measured by the sensor at this point in time.  | [optional] 
**unit_code** | **str** | Property Value&#39;s unit code.  | [optional] 
**dataset_id** | **str** | It allows identifying a set or group of target relationship objects.  | [optional] 
**created_at** | **datetime** | It is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was entered into an NGSI-LD system.  Entity creation timestamp. See clause 4.8.  | [optional] 
**modified_at** | **datetime** | It is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was last modified in an NGSI-LD system, e.g. in order to correct a previously entered incorrect value.  Entity last modification timestamp. See clause 4.8.  | [optional] 
**deleted_at** | **datetime** | It is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was deleted from an NGSI-LD system.  Entity deletion timestamp. See clause 4.8.

**instance_id** | **str** | A URI uniquely identifying a Relationship instance as mandated by clause 4.5.8. System generated. Only used in temporal representation of Relationships.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**previous_value** | [**Geometry**](Geometry.md) |  | [optional] 
**object** | [**RelationshipObject**](RelationshipObject.md) |  | [optional] 
**object_type** | [**RelationshipObjectType**](RelationshipObjectType.md) |  | [optional] 
**previous_object** | [**RelationshipPreviousObject**](RelationshipPreviousObject.md) |  | [optional] 
**entity** | [**RelationshipEntity**](RelationshipEntity.md) |  | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models_mdt_client_data_materialization.models.entity_value import EntityValue

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of EntityValue from a JSON string
entity_value_instance = EntityValue.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(EntityValue.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
entity_value_dict = entity_value_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of EntityValue from a dict
entity_value_from_dict = EntityValue.from_dict(entity_value_dict)
