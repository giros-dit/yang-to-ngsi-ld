# InterfaceStateEnabled

This leaf contains the configured, desired state of the interface.  Systems that implement the IF-MIB use the value of this leaf in the 'running' datastore to set IF-MIB.ifAdminStatus to 'up' or 'down' after an ifEntry has been initialized, as described in RFC 2863.  Changes in this leaf in the 'running' datastore are reflected in ifAdminStatus, but if ifAdminStatus is changed over SNMP, this leaf is not affected.  Reference: RFC 2863: The Interfaces Group MIB - ifAdminStatus  YANG module: openconfig-interfaces.yang 

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**type** | **str** | Node type.  | [optional] [default to 'Property']
**value** | **bool** |  | [default to True]
**observed_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which a certain Property or Relationship became valid or was observed. For example, a temperature Value was measured by the sensor at this point in time.  | [optional] 
**unit_code** | **str** | Property Value&#39;s unit code.  | [optional] 
**dataset_id** | **str** | It allows identifying a set or group of property values.  | [optional] 
**created_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was entered into an NGSI-LD system.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**modified_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was last modified in an NGSI-LD system, e.g. in order to correct a previously entered incorrect value.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**deleted_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was deleted from an NGSI-LD system.  Entity deletion timestamp. See clause 4.8 It is only used in notifications reporting deletions and in the Temporal Representation of Entities (clause 4.5.6), Properties (clause 4.5.7), Relationships (clause 4.5.8) and LanguageProperties (clause 5.2.32).  | [optional] [readonly] 
**instance_id** | **str** | A URI uniquely identifying a Property instance, as mandated by (see clause 4.5.7). System generated.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**previous_value** | [**PropertyPreviousValue**](PropertyPreviousValue.md) |  | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.interface_state_enabled import InterfaceStateEnabled

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of InterfaceStateEnabled from a JSON string
interface_state_enabled_instance = InterfaceStateEnabled.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print InterfaceStateEnabled.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
interface_state_enabled_dict = interface_state_enabled_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of InterfaceStateEnabled from a dict
interface_state_enabled_form_dict = interface_state_enabled.from_dict(interface_state_enabled_dict)
