## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.link_ref import LinkRef

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of LinkRef from a JSON string
link_ref_instance = LinkRef.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print LinkRef.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
link_ref_dict = link_ref_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of LinkRef from a dict
link_ref_form_dict = link_ref.from_dict(link_ref_dict)
