# Network

Describes a network. A network typically contains an inventory of nodes, topological information (augmented through the network-topology data model), and layering information.  YANG module: ietf-network.yang 

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**id** | **str** | Entity id.  | [optional] 
**type** | **str** | NGSI-LD Entity identifier. It has to be Network. | [default to 'Network']
**scope** | [**EntityScope**](EntityScope.md) |  | [optional] 
**location** | [**GeoProperty**](GeoProperty.md) |  | [optional] 
**observation_space** | [**GeoProperty**](GeoProperty.md) |  | [optional] 
**operation_space** | [**GeoProperty**](GeoProperty.md) |  | [optional] 
**created_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was entered into an NGSI-LD system.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**modified_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was last modified in an NGSI-LD system, e.g. in order to correct a previously entered incorrect value.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**deleted_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was deleted from an NGSI-LD system.  Entity deletion timestamp. See clause 4.8 It is only used in notifications reporting deletions and in the Temporal Representation of Entities (clause 4.5.6), Properties (clause 4.5.7), Relationships (clause 4.5.8) and LanguageProperties (clause 5.2.32).  | [optional] [readonly] 
**network_id** | [**NetworkId**](NetworkId.md) |  | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.network import Network

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of Network from a JSON string
network_instance = Network.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print Network.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
network_dict = network_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of Network from a dict
network_form_dict = network.from_dict(network_dict)
```
