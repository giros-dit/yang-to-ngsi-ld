## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.network_supporting_network import NetworkSupportingNetwork

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of NetworkSupportingNetwork from a JSON string
network_supporting_network_instance = NetworkSupportingNetwork.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print NetworkSupportingNetwork.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
network_supporting_network_dict = network_supporting_network_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of NetworkSupportingNetwork from a dict
network_supporting_network_form_dict = network_supporting_network.from_dict(network_supporting_network_dict)
