**observed_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which a certain Property or Relationship became valid or was observed. For example, a temperature Value was measured by the sensor at this point in time.  | [optional] 
**dataset_id** | **str** | It allows identifying a set or group of target relationship objects.  | [optional]

## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.dest_node import DestNode

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of DestNode from a JSON string
dest_node_instance = DestNode.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print DestNode.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
dest_node_dict = dest_node_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of DestNode from a dict
dest_node_form_dict = dest_node.from_dict(dest_node_dict)
