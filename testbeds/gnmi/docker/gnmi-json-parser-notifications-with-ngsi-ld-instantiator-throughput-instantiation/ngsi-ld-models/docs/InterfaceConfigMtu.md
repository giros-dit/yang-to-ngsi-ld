Set the max transmission unit size in octets for the physical interface. If this is not set, the mtu is set to the operational default -- e.g., 1514 bytes on an Ethernet interface.  YANG module: openconfig-interfaces.yang 

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**type** | **str** | Node type.  | [optional] [default to 'Property']
**value** | **int** |  | 
**observed_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which a certain Property or Relationship became valid or was observed. For example, a temperature Value was measured by the sensor at this point in time.  | [optional] 
**unit_code** | **str** | Property Value&#39;s unit code.  | [optional] 
**dataset_id** | **str** | It allows identifying a set or group of property values.  | [optional] 
**created_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was entered into an NGSI-LD system.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**modified_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was last modified in an NGSI-LD system, e.g. in order to correct a previously entered incorrect value.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**deleted_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was deleted from an NGSI-LD system.  Entity deletion timestamp. See clause 4.8 It is only used in notifications reporting deletions and in the Temporal Representation of Entities (clause 4.5.6), Properties (clause 4.5.7), Relationships (clause 4.5.8) and LanguageProperties (clause 5.2.32).  | [optional] [readonly] 
**instance_id** | **str** | A URI uniquely identifying a Property instance, as mandated by (see clause 4.5.7). System generated.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**previous_value** | [**PropertyPreviousValue**](PropertyPreviousValue.md) |  | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.interface_config_mtu import InterfaceConfigMtu

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of InterfaceConfigMtu from a JSON string
interface_config_mtu_instance = InterfaceConfigMtu.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print InterfaceConfigMtu.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
interface_config_mtu_dict = interface_config_mtu_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of InterfaceConfigMtu from a dict
interface_config_mtu_form_dict = interface_config_mtu.from_dict(interface_config_mtu_dict)
