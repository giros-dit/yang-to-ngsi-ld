## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.negotiated_port_speed import NegotiatedPortSpeed

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of NegotiatedPortSpeed from a JSON string
negotiated_port_speed_instance = NegotiatedPortSpeed.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print NegotiatedPortSpeed.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
negotiated_port_speed_dict = negotiated_port_speed_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of NegotiatedPortSpeed from a dict
negotiated_port_speed_form_dict = negotiated_port_speed.from_dict(negotiated_port_speed_dict)
