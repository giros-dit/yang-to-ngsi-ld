**observed_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which a certain Property or Relationship became valid or was observed. For example, a temperature Value was measured by the sensor at this point in time.  | [optional] 
**unit_code** | **str** | Property Value&#39;s unit code.  | [optional] 
**dataset_id** | **str** | It allows identifying a set or group of property values.  | [optional]

**deleted_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was deleted from an NGSI-LD system.  Entity deletion timestamp. See clause 4.8 It is only used in notifications reporting deletions and in the Temporal Representation of Entities (clause 4.5.6), Properties (clause 4.5.7), Relationships (clause 4.5.8) and LanguageProperties (clause 5.2.32).  | [optional] [readonly]

## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.label6 import Label6

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of Label6 from a JSON string
label6_instance = Label6.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print Label6.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
label6_dict = label6_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of Label6 from a dict
label6_form_dict = label6.from_dict(label6_dict)
