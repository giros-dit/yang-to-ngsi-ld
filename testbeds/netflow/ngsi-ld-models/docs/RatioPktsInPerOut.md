## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.ratio_pkts_in_per_out import RatioPktsInPerOut

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of RatioPktsInPerOut from a JSON string
ratio_pkts_in_per_out_instance = RatioPktsInPerOut.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print RatioPktsInPerOut.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
ratio_pkts_in_per_out_dict = ratio_pkts_in_per_out_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of RatioPktsInPerOut from a dict
ratio_pkts_in_per_out_form_dict = ratio_pkts_in_per_out.from_dict(ratio_pkts_in_per_out_dict)
