## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.pkts_out import PktsOut

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of PktsOut from a JSON string
pkts_out_instance = PktsOut.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print PktsOut.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
pkts_out_dict = pkts_out_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of PktsOut from a dict
pkts_out_form_dict = pkts_out.from_dict(pkts_out_dict)
