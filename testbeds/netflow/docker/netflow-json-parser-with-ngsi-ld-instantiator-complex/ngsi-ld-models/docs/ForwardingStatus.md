## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.forwarding_status import ForwardingStatus

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of ForwardingStatus from a JSON string
forwarding_status_instance = ForwardingStatus.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print ForwardingStatus.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
forwarding_status_dict = forwarding_status_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of ForwardingStatus from a dict
forwarding_status_form_dict = forwarding_status.from_dict(forwarding_status_dict)
