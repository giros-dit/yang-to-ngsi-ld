## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.size import Size

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of Size from a JSON string
size_instance = Size.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print Size.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
size_dict = size_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of Size from a dict
size_form_dict = size.from_dict(size_dict)
