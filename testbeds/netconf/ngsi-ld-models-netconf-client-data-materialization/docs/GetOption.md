## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models_netconf_client_data_materialization.models.get_option import GetOption

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of GetOption from a JSON string
get_option_instance = GetOption.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(GetOption.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
get_option_dict = get_option_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of GetOption from a dict
get_option_from_dict = GetOption.from_dict(get_option_dict)
