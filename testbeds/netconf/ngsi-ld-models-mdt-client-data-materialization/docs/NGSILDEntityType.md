## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models_mdt_client_data_materialization.models.ngsild_entity_type import NGSILDEntityType

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of NGSILDEntityType from a JSON string
ngsild_entity_type_instance = NGSILDEntityType.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(NGSILDEntityType.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
ngsild_entity_type_dict = ngsild_entity_type_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of NGSILDEntityType from a dict
ngsild_entity_type_from_dict = NGSILDEntityType.from_dict(ngsild_entity_type_dict)
