## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models_netconf_client_data_virtualization.models.port import Port

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of Port from a JSON string
port_instance = Port.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(Port.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
port_dict = port_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of Port from a dict
port_from_dict = Port.from_dict(port_dict)
