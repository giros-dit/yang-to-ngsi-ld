## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**type** | **str** | Node type.  | [optional] [default to 'Property']
**value** | **int** |  | [default to 86400]
**observed_at** | **datetime** | It is defined as the temporal Property at which a certain Property or Relationship became valid or was observed. For example, a temperature Value was measured by the sensor at this point in time.  | [optional] 
**unit_code** | **str** | Property Value&#39;s unit code.  | [optional] 
**dataset_id** | **str** | It allows identifying a set or group of property values.  | [optional] 
**created_at** | **datetime** | It is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was entered into an NGSI-LD system.  Entity creation timestamp. See clause 4.8.  | [optional] 
**modified_at** | **datetime** | It is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was last modified in an NGSI-LD system, e.g. in order to correct a previously entered incorrect value.  Entity last modification timestamp. See clause 4.8.  | [optional] 
**deleted_at** | **datetime** | It is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was deleted from an NGSI-LD system.  Entity deletion timestamp. See clause 4.8. It is only used in notifications reporting deletions and in the Temporal Representation of Entities (clause 4.5.6), Properties (clause 4.5.7), Relationships (clause 4.5.8) and LanguageProperties (clause 5.2.32).  | [optional] 
**instance_id** | **str** | A URI uniquely identifying a Property instance as  mandated by clause 4.5.7. System generated. Only used in temporal representation of Properties.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**previous_value** | [**PropertyPreviousValue**](PropertyPreviousValue.md) |  | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models_ietf_interfaces.models.temporary_preferred_lifetime import TemporaryPreferredLifetime

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of TemporaryPreferredLifetime from a JSON string
temporary_preferred_lifetime_instance = TemporaryPreferredLifetime.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(TemporaryPreferredLifetime.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
temporary_preferred_lifetime_dict = temporary_preferred_lifetime_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of TemporaryPreferredLifetime from a dict
temporary_preferred_lifetime_from_dict = TemporaryPreferredLifetime.from_dict(temporary_preferred_lifetime_dict)
