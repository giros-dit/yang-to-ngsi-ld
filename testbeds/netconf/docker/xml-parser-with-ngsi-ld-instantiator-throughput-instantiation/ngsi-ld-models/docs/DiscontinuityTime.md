# DiscontinuityTime

The time on the most recent occasion at which any one or more of this interface's counters suffered a discontinuity. If no such discontinuities have occurred since the last re-initialization of the local management subsystem, then this node contains the time the local management subsystem re-initialized itself.  YANG module: ietf-interfaces.yang 

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**type** | **str** | Node type.  | [optional] [default to 'Property']
**value** | **str** |  | 
**observed_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which a certain Property or Relationship became valid or was observed. For example, a temperature Value was measured by the sensor at this point in time.  | [optional] 
**unit_code** | **str** | Property Value&#39;s unit code.  | [optional] 
**dataset_id** | **str** | It allows identifying a set or group of property values.  | [optional] 
**created_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was entered into an NGSI-LD system.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**modified_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was last modified in an NGSI-LD system, e.g. in order to correct a previously entered incorrect value.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**deleted_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was deleted from an NGSI-LD system.  Entity deletion timestamp. See clause 4.8 It is only used in notifications reporting deletions and in the Temporal Representation of Entities (clause 4.5.6), Properties (clause 4.5.7), Relationships (clause 4.5.8) and LanguageProperties (clause 5.2.32).  | [optional] [readonly] 
**instance_id** | **str** | A URI uniquely identifying a Property instance, as mandated by (see clause 4.5.7). System generated.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**previous_value** | [**PropertyPreviousValue**](PropertyPreviousValue.md) |  | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.discontinuity_time import DiscontinuityTime

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of DiscontinuityTime from a JSON string
discontinuity_time_instance = DiscontinuityTime.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print DiscontinuityTime.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
discontinuity_time_dict = discontinuity_time_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of DiscontinuityTime from a dict
discontinuity_time_form_dict = discontinuity_time.from_dict(discontinuity_time_dict)
