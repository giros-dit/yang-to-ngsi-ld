# LinkUpDownTrapEnable

Controls whether linkUp/linkDown SNMP notifications should be generated for this interface.  If this node is not configured, the value 'enabled' is operationally used by the server for interfaces that do not operate on top of any other interface (i.e., there are no 'lower-layer-if' entries), and 'disabled' otherwise.  Reference: RFC 2863: The Interfaces Group MIB -      ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable  YANG module: ietf-interfaces.yang

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**type** | **str** | Node type.  | [optional] [default to 'Property']
**value** | **str** |  | 
**observed_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which a certain Property or Relationship became valid or was observed. For example, a temperature Value was measured by the sensor at this point in time.  | [optional] 
**unit_code** | **str** | Property Value&#39;s unit code.  | [optional] 
**dataset_id** | **str** | It allows identifying a set or group of property values.  | [optional] 
**created_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was entered into an NGSI-LD system.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**modified_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was last modified in an NGSI-LD system, e.g. in order to correct a previously entered incorrect value.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**deleted_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was deleted from an NGSI-LD system.  Entity deletion timestamp. See clause 4.8 It is only used in notifications reporting deletions and in the Temporal Representation of Entities (clause 4.5.6), Properties (clause 4.5.7), Relationships (clause 4.5.8) and LanguageProperties (clause 5.2.32).  | [optional] [readonly] 
**instance_id** | **str** | A URI uniquely identifying a Property instance, as mandated by (see clause 4.5.7). System generated.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**previous_value** | [**PropertyPreviousValue**](PropertyPreviousValue.md) |  | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.link_up_down_trap_enable import LinkUpDownTrapEnable

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of LinkUpDownTrapEnable from a JSON string
link_up_down_trap_enable_instance = LinkUpDownTrapEnable.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print LinkUpDownTrapEnable.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
link_up_down_trap_enable_dict = link_up_down_trap_enable_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of LinkUpDownTrapEnable from a dict
link_up_down_trap_enable_form_dict = link_up_down_trap_enable.from_dict(link_up_down_trap_enable_dict)
