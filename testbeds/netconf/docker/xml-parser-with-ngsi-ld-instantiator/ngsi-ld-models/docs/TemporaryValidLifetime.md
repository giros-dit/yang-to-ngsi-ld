## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.temporary_valid_lifetime import TemporaryValidLifetime

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of TemporaryValidLifetime from a JSON string
temporary_valid_lifetime_instance = TemporaryValidLifetime.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print TemporaryValidLifetime.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
temporary_valid_lifetime_dict = temporary_valid_lifetime_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of TemporaryValidLifetime from a dict
temporary_valid_lifetime_form_dict = temporary_valid_lifetime.from_dict(temporary_valid_lifetime_dict)
