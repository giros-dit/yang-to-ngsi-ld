# PhysAddress

The interface's address at its protocol sub-layer. For example, for an 802.x interface, this object normally contains a Media Access Control (MAC) address. The interface's media-specific modules must define the bit and byte ordering and the format of the value of this object. For interfaces that do not have such an address (e.g., a serial line), this node is not present.  YANG module: ietf-interfaces.yang 

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**type** | **str** | Node type.  | [optional] [default to 'Property']
**value** | **str** |  | 
**observed_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which a certain Property or Relationship became valid or was observed. For example, a temperature Value was measured by the sensor at this point in time.  | [optional] 
**unit_code** | **str** | Property Value&#39;s unit code.  | [optional] 
**dataset_id** | **str** | It allows identifying a set or group of property values.  | [optional] 
**created_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was entered into an NGSI-LD system.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**modified_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was last modified in an NGSI-LD system, e.g. in order to correct a previously entered incorrect value.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**deleted_at** | **datetime** | Is defined as the temporal Property at which the Entity, Property or Relationship was deleted from an NGSI-LD system.  Entity deletion timestamp. See clause 4.8 It is only used in notifications reporting deletions and in the Temporal Representation of Entities (clause 4.5.6), Properties (clause 4.5.7), Relationships (clause 4.5.8) and LanguageProperties (clause 5.2.32).  | [optional] [readonly] 
**instance_id** | **str** | A URI uniquely identifying a Property instance, as mandated by (see clause 4.5.7). System generated.  | [optional] [readonly] 
**previous_value** | [**PropertyPreviousValue**](PropertyPreviousValue.md) |  | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models.models.phys_address import PhysAddress

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of PhysAddress from a JSON string
phys_address_instance = PhysAddress.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print PhysAddress.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
phys_address_dict = phys_address_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of PhysAddress from a dict
phys_address_form_dict = phys_address.from_dict(phys_address_dict)
