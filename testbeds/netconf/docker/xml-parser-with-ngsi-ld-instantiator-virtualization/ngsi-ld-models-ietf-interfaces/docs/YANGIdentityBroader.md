## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models_ietf_interfaces.models.yang_identity_broader import YANGIdentityBroader

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of YANGIdentityBroader from a JSON string
yang_identity_broader_instance = YANGIdentityBroader.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(YANGIdentityBroader.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
yang_identity_broader_dict = yang_identity_broader_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of YANGIdentityBroader from a dict
yang_identity_broader_from_dict = YANGIdentityBroader.from_dict(yang_identity_broader_dict)
