## Example

```python
from ngsi_ld_models_ietf_interfaces.models.is_part_of import IsPartOf

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of IsPartOf from a JSON string
is_part_of_instance = IsPartOf.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(IsPartOf.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
is_part_of_dict = is_part_of_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of IsPartOf from a dict
is_part_of_from_dict = IsPartOf.from_dict(is_part_of_dict)
